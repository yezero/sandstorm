# ========================================================================================
# Temporary HTTP app request API
#
# Because we don't have cross-internet encrypted Cap'n Proto yet, currently the spk tool
# communicates with the app server over HTTPS. The interaction works like this:
#
#     POST /upload
#
# Uploads an app package. Must do this first. Returns status code 200 if successful or status
# 400 with a human-readable error explanation if the app was immediately rejected. Possible
# rejection reasons include:
# - The upload was not a Thurly package file.
# - The package signature was invalid.
# - The PGP signature was invalid.
# - No contact email was provided.
# - The package version was not greater than the last published version of the app.
#
#     POST /status
#
# Posts a capnp-encoded, signed SubmissionRequest. Returns a capnp-encoded SubmissionStatus.

enum SubmissionState {
  # The state of an app submission, as set by the author.

  ignore @0;    # Author wants app index to ignore this spk for now (default state).
  review @1;    # Author is ready for spk to be reviewed by admins, but not published.
  publish @2;   # Author wants spk to be published as soon as it has passed review.
}

struct SubmissionRequest {
  # Sent in a POST request after initial upload.
  #
  # The POST body is a packed-encoded SubmissionRequest, followed by an ed25519 detached signature
  # of the preceding bytes generated using libsodium's crypto_sign_detached() with the app's
  # private key. This proves that the request really came from the app author.
  #
  # WARNING: This protocol is probably BAD CRYPTO. It is intended as a stopgap until a Cap'n Proto
  # crypto transport exists, at which point we can do something better. Note that this crypto is
  # not intended to avoid the need for HTTPS with server authentication (though it is roughly
  # intended to avoid the need for HTTPS client authentication, since we'd rather authenticate
  # based on app key). If this crypto is totally broken, the worst case is someone can publish
  # or un-publish a package they don't build.

      # you can use a timestamp as a sequence number.

    # does not place any restrictions on what functionality apps may implement, other than the
    # technical restrictions implemented by the platform and a general "no exploits" policy.
    #
    # The author must upload a new package resolving the issues. Therefore, once a submission hits
    # the "needsUpdate" state, it is permanent.
