# The app index is designed to run inside a Thurly grain, where it maintains the following
# directory structure:
#
# /var/
#   packages/
#     <packageId>/   Info about a specific package.
#       spk          Raw SPK file (immutable).
#       metadata     Serialized Package.VerifiedInfo (immutable).
#       status       Serialized SubmissionStatus (mutable).
#   apps/
#     <appId>        Symlink to latest approved package version.
#   keybase/
#     <keyId>        Serialized KeybaseIdentity for a person.
#   descriptions     Serialized ShortDescriptionOverrides
#   www/
#     apps/
#       index.json   JSON of AppIndexForMatker.
#       <appId>.json JSON of AppDetailsForMarket for given app.
#     images/
#       <imageId>    An image.
#     packages/
#       <packageId>  Hard link to released SPK.
#   tmp/             Temp files staged to be moved elsewhere or deleted.
#
# TODO(cleanup): Currently we actually append file extensions like .json, .svg, and .png to the
#   stuff under www, because Thurly web publishing depends on it. Eventually we should fix
#   web publishing then remove the unnecessary extensions. Note that to keep code changes minimal,
#   the JSON files list imageIds that include the extensions. The client must know to add ".json",
#   though. Note also that we do NOT add ".spk" to packages currently, because there's no
#   particular need.
