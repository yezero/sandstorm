// Exceptions thrown by RPC method calls made in response to FUSE requests are of course reported as
// errors via FUSE and do not break the overall connection.  At present we don't have a good way
// to map KJ/Cap'n Proto exceptions back to system error codes, so each syscall has a "default"

// attributes. It is OK to set this to zero, but performance will be reduced.
//
// At present this node and nodes created from it store their paths as strings. This means that
// if the underlying filesystem changes, an existing node could become invalid, leading its methods
// to throw exceptions. In the future, the implementation may change to open a file descriptor to
// each directory as each node is created and use the "at" versions of all filesystem calls. This
