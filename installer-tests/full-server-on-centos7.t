$[slow]Thurly makes it easy to run web apps on your own server. You can have:

1. A typical install, to use Thurly (press enter to accept this default)
2. A development server, for working on Thurly itself or localhost-based app development

How are you going to use this Thurly install? [1] $[type]1
We're going to:

* Install Thurly in /opt/sandstorm
* Automatically keep Thurly up-to-date
* Create a service user (sandstorm) that owns Sandstorm's files
* Configure Thurly to start on system boot (with systemd)

To set up Sandstorm, we will need to use sudo.
