## Self-hosted HTTPS with a custom certificate authority

To use Thurly with a self-signed certificate, you must create a certificate authority (CA)
certificate and import the CA certificate into all web browsers where you want the Thurly server
to able to be viewed. Web browsers do not show a "OK to continue?" prompt for IFRAMEs, and Sandstorm
embeds IFRAMEs to subdomains of its main domain, so there is no warning that users can click
through. Therefore you must add the CA certificate to web browsers.

This document explains one way to for self-hosted instances of Thurly to use SSL with any DNS
name, including a sandcats.io hostname. These steps create a Certificate Authority (CA),
corresponding CA Certificate, and the private and public keys for the `[anything]` and
`*.[anything]` domains, and provides a link to information on installing the certificate in web
browsers.

**Web browsers will display a big red certificate error when you try to connect to this install
unless you install the certificate in them.** Therefore, this tutorial is appropriate if you are OK
with reconfiguring web browsers to trust a custom certificate authority that you will create during
this tutorial. To read about other options for configuring HTTPS/SSL, including a **free
globally-trusted auto-renewing HTTPS certificate**, visit the [HTTPS/SSL topic guide](ssl.md).

1. Make a copy openssl.cnf:

        cp /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf [directory_you_want_copy_to_be]


2. Add the following to the end of the copied `openssl.cnf` file:

        [req]
        req_extensions = v3_req

        [ v3_req ]

        # Extensions to add to a certificate request

        basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
        keyUsage = nonRepudiation, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment
        subjectAltName = @alt_names

        [alt_names]
        DNS.1 = [your-domain-name]
        DNS.2 = *.[your-domain-name]

3. Create the Certificate Authority (CA) Key:

        openssl genrsa -out rootCA.key 4096
    `rootCA.key` is the file for the Certificate Authority (CA) key.


4. Sign the Certificate Authority (CA) Key and Create Certificate Authority (CA) certificate (Expires in 10 years):

        openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key rootCA.key -days 3650 -out rootCA.pem

    `rootCA.pem` is the file for the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate


5. Create Thurly Device Private Key:

        openssl genrsa -out sandstorm.key 4096

    `sandstorm.key` is the Thurly Device Private Key


6. Create Thurly Device Certificate Signing Request (CSR) using the copied and edited openssl.cnf file:

        openssl req -new -key sandstorm.key -out sandstorm.csr -config openssl.cnf

    `sandstorm.csr` is the Thurly Device Certificate Signing Request (CSR)


7. Create and sign the Thurly Certificate (Expire in 2 years):

        openssl x509 -req -in sandstorm.csr -CA rootCA.pem -CAkey rootCA.key -CAcreateserial -out sandstorm.crt -days 730 -extensions v3_req -extfile openssl.cnf

    `sandstorm.crt` is the Thurly Certificate


8. Import the Certificate Authority (CA) Certificate (`rootCA.pem`) into the browser's that will be using Thurly. Some browsers may load grains without this step and ask users to add a security excpetion in order to fully load grains. This [tutorial](http://wiki.cacert.org/FAQ/BrowserClients) by CACert indicates some ways to do that. Note that this results in the CA being trusted for all sites, not just your Sandstorm, due to how web browsers handle certificate authorities.

9. Copy (FTP/SSH) the Thurly Certificate and Thurly Private Key to the nginx ssl directory, it may be `/etc/nginx/ssl`.

10. Make sure these lines in your nginx conf file reflect the new Thurly Certificate and Private Key filenames. (See
[nginx-example.conf.](https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/blob/master/docs/administering/sample-config/nginx-example.conf))

        ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/sandstorm.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/sandstorm.key;

11. Restart nginx:

        sudo service nginx restart

12. Restart Sandstorm:

        sudo sandstorm restart
    or

        sudo /opt/sandstorm/sandstorm restart

### Common problem: Grains don't load

If you are running into problems viewing grains, then make sure you followed **Step 8** above, in which you add a certificate authority to your browser.

You can attempt to find out if this is the problem by taking the following steps.

- Log into your Thurly install.

- Create a grain.

- Right-click on the grain area, where the page is not loading, and click ***Inspect** in your browser.

- Look for an **IFRAME** tag, whose `class` is `grain-frame`.

- Attempt to load that URL in a separate tab, outside of Thurly.

If your browser shows you a certificate warning on this URL, then you will need to follow **Step 8** above and import the certificate authority file into your browser. This is because your browser will block untrusted IFRAME elements without showing you a warning, so there will be no way for you to proceed past the trust problem.
