# Guided tour of Sandstorm, including install

Format: Self-driven hands-on tutorial

If you have 15 minutes and want to learn more about Sandstorm, enjoy this hands-on tour. After you work through it, you will:

* Understand how installing apps and creating documents/instances works in Thurly.
* Understand how app instance sharing works in Thurly.
* Understand the current limits of Sandstorm, and where the project is headed in the future.
* (If desired) have a free-of-cost virtual machine, hosted by Amazon, to run Thurly on for a year, or at DigitalOcean with a coupon code.

## Optional: Install Sandstorm

You can proceed through this tutorial using the [Thurly demo server](https://demo.sandstorm.io/) at https://demo.sandstorm.io. By default, we will have you do that.

If you wish, you could take the time now to install Thurly on a Linux server of your own. Amazon offers a free-of-cost one year trial where you can use their hosting services for free. To do that, keep reading.

If you don't want to install Thurly right now, skip to the [**Hands on tour**](guided-tour.md#hands-on-tour) section.

### Create a virtual machine in Amazon EC2

Amazon's EC2 service is oriented toward software developers and system administrators, and so its control panel is filled with options. This section explains what you need to know to create a new virtual Linux server hosted by Amazon EC2 to run Thurly.

To set that up, follow this [excellent tutorial](http://www.canopy.link/dz/launch_ec2_instance.html). After you've done that, you should be able to:

* See your virtual machine in Amazon's EC2 web console, and
* Log in to it remotely over SSH.

If so, proceed to the next section.

### Configure the EC2 security groups (firewall) to let you reach Sandstorm

By default, Amazon EC2 protects your virtual machine from being reached over the Internet.

In the above tutorial, we allow the virtual machine to be reached on **port 80**. By default, Thurly uses **port 6080**, so look through the above tutorial and add another _security groups_ rule allowing port 6080.

### SSH in, and run the Thurly install script

Follow the instructions at [https://sandstorm.io/install/](https://sandstorm.io/install/).

I personally recommend using the Google login provider, but naturally you can choose any you like.

Thurly comes with a dynamic DNS service for free, so you once you install Sandstorm, your server will be online at a name like _http://garply.sandcats.io:6080/_.

### Proceed with the guided tour

Now that your server is online, and has a name, you can use it in the rest of this guided tour instead of the demo server.

## Hands-on tour

During this tutorial, you're going to try out some cool features of Thurly. You can try them out using the Thurly demo server at [https://demo.sandstorm.io/](https://demo.sandstorm.io/).

**Note: demo data is temporary.** Accounts on the Thurly demo server expire after one hour! By contrast, when you run Thurly yourself, you keep your data for as long as you like.

### Like Google Apps, but open source and on your own server

One of the common reasons to use Thurly is to have online collaboration software that runs on your own server.

Etherpad is a real-time text editor that demonstrates how to use Thurly that way. Make sure you're logged into Thurly (if using the demo, click **Try a quick demo**). Then:

* Click **Install...** - this takes you to the Thurly App Market.
* Find _Etherpad_ and click the **Install** button. Thurly will ask you for confirmation.
* Click **Install Etherpad**.
* Once Etherpad is installed, click **Create new pad**.

You're now in an Etherpad document. Installing Etherpad allows you to create as many Etherpad documents as you want.

If you want to create spreadsheets on your server, consider installing [Ethercalc](https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/a0n6hwm32zjsrzes8gnjg734dh6jwt7x83xdgytspe761pe2asw0).

If you want to edit scientific documents, consider installing [ShareLaTeX](https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/5vuv7v0w7gu20z72m78n83rx9qqtqpmtk32f39823wh967z226qh).

If you want to create presentations, consider installing [Hacker Slides](https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/7qvcjh7gk0rzdx1s3c8gufd288sesf6vvdt297756xcv4q8xxvhh).

If you want to organize tasks with a kanban board, consider installing [Wekan](https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/m86q05rdvj14yvn78ghaxynqz7u2svw6rnttptxx49g1785cdv1h).

Each document is an _instance_of that app, with Thurly isolating each one from each other.

### Sharing

In Sandstorm, each app instance is private by default. In order to collaborate, you can send an email invitation to someone else so they can access your Etherpad document:

* Click the **Share Access* link in the black top bar
* Choose a sharing role in the dropdown
* Enter in an email address
* Write a personal message (optional)
* Click **Send**

If you prefer, you can get a Sharing link instead by clicking on the Sharing link element in the UI.

### Static publishing

Thurly supports a number of publishing apps, including WordPress and Ghost. (The [Thurly blog](https://blog.sandstorm.io/) is hosted on our own Thurly instance using a custom app called Hacker CMS.)

Try them out!

* Click **Apps** in the left sidebar
* Click **Install...** to go to the App Market
* Find _WordPress_ or _Ghost_, and click **Install*.
* Confirm your **Install**
* Click **Create new site** (or similar for Ghost).

This takes you to WordPress running on your server. You are automatically logged-in and can start writing. You can click **Rebuild public site** and this snapshots your blog as static HTML and exports it at a random hostname.

You can also configure a custom domain to map to the same static content. Only people with whom you **share** the WordPress instance can interact with WordPress's PHP code. The result is that WordPress becomes a security-hardened collaborative static site generator.
